This recipe shows a single blue view. Constraints stretch the view to fill the available space with a small margin.

Unlike the Simple Single View recipe, this version adapts to its current context. The exact spacing of the top and bottom margins is at least 8 points away from the edge of the nearest neighbor and at least 20 points away from the top and bottom of the superview.

You can see this layout when the view is displayed full screen. Long-tap on the blue view to switch to full-screen mode. As you rotate the device, the view automatically adapts to the presence or absence of the status bar. When the status bar is present, the view positions itself 8 points below the status bar. When the status bar is absent, it positions itself 20 points from the top of the screen.
