This recipe uses size-class-specific constraints:

1) Compact-Compact and Regular-Compact layouts display the red and green boxes stacked horizontally.

2) The Compact-Regular layout displays the red and green boxes stacked vertically.

3) The Regular-Regular layout displays a 2 x 2 grid containing the red, blue, green, and yellow boxes.

To support these layouts, the red and green boxes are installed on all size classes, but the blue and yellow boxes are installed only for the Regular-Regular layout.

The Any-Compact layout defines the horizontal stack, and the Compact-Regular layout defines the vertical stack. Each size class installs only the constraints it needs for its layout.

You can design all of this dynamic behavior directly in Interface Builder. Then whenever the size class changes, the system automatically changes the constraints and animates them.
