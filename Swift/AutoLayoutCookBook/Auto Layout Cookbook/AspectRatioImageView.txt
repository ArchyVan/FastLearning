This recipe demonstrates how to lay out an image view using an explicit aspect-ratio constraint. Here, you add a constraint to maintain the image's aspect ratio. This has the advantage of ensuring that the image always fills its frame, letting you position other views adjacent to the image. 

Before you can create the constraint, you must know the image's aspect ratio. If you want to dynamically swap images, you must remove the old aspect-ratio constraint and add a new aspect-ratio constraint whenever the image changes.
