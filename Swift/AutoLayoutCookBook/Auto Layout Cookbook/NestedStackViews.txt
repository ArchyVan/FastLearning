This recipe displays a complex layout using a hierarchy of nested stack views. The layout's appearance is controlled by adjusting the stack view's attributes and by setting the content-hugging and compression-resistance priority of the contents. Additional constraints are then added to fine-tune the layout's appearance. For example, the text fields are all given equal width constraints, and the image view is given a square aspect ratio.
