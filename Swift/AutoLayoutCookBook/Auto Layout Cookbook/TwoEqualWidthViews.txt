This recipe demonstrates two equal-width views that fill the scene with a small margin.

In the example, the yellow view is pinned to the leading, top, and bottom edges, and the green view is pinned to the trailing, top, and bottom edges. Notice that there is a standard space between the two views, and they have equal widths.
