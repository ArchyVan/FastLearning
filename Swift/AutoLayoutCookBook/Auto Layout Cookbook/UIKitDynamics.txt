This recipe demonstrates how to mix UIKit Dynamics and Auto Layout.

When a view's position is controlled by UIKit Dynamics, you must use frame-based layout for that view. Set its translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints property to true, and do not use Auto Layout constraints to define its position or size.

You can, however, use Auto Layout to lay out the view's content or to lay out other items relative to this view (for example, a caption label that should move relative to the view.)

In this recipe, you are defining the view as an accessory view. By default, these views have translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints set to true.
