This recipe shows two views that fill the scene with a small margin. The orange view is twice as wide as the purple view.

The purple view is pinned to the leading, top, and bottom. The orange view is pinned to the trailing, top, and bottom. There is a standard space between the two views, and the orange view's width is constrained to the purple view's width x 2.
