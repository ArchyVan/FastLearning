This recipe demonstrates how to lay out rows of label-and-text-field pairs. Each row is baseline aligned and vertically positioned based on the tallest view in the row. This vertical layout  dynamically adapts as the label font size changes: When the labels are taller than the text fields, the labels determine the vertical layout. When the labels are shorter, the text fields determine the vertical layout. This recipe uses the same vertical layout technique used in Label and Text Field with Dynamic Height recipe. Here, however, that vertical layout has been expanded to a multirow layout.
